# ![Lab Flask](./images/lab-flask.png) GraalVM Workshops and Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of workshops and tutorials to help you learn and apply GraalVM tools and capabilities.
It also provides workshops that deep-dive into particular topics, such as Native Image configuration or static linking.

These workshops are continually tested against the latest GraalVM release.

You can find an alternative version of some of these workshops at [Luna Labs](https://luna.oracle.com/) - an interactive workshop platform running in Oracle Cloud and providing users with an Oracle Linux host machine and necessary cloud resources to complete the steps.
Go to [luna.oracle.com](https://luna.oracle.com/) to try these workshops online and search for **graalvm**.
