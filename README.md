# ![Lab Flask](./images/lab-flask.png) GraalVM Workshops and Tutorials

This repository contains several workshops and tutorials that will guide you through getting started with 
and using GraalVM. It also provides workshops that deep-dive into particular topics, such as how reflection 
and Class loading works within GraalVM Native Image.

This repository is continually updated with new workshops and tutorials added frequently. Please check in regularly
to keep up to date.

To find out more about GraalVM, take a look at our website: [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org).

[Oracle's Luna Labs - Search GraalVM](https://luna.oracle.com), to try these workshops out online. Search for **graalvm**

## Using the Workshops and Tutorials

All of the workshops are written so that they will work on your own device (laptop, server). Each workshop begins with
prerequisites that you need to have installed. Please make sure you read these.

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graalvm/workshops.git
```

Open a terminal, change directory to the workshop / tutorial you want to try out. Read the `README.md` file.
The workshops are organized into directories as follows:

* `native-image` : This collects all workshops related to GraalVM Native Image

We will add more directories as we add more content including ones relating to `native-image`, `polyglot` and using
GraalVM as a Java runtime.

## Native Image Workshops and Tutorials

### ![Lab Flask](./images/lab-flask.png) [GraalVM Native Image Quick Start](native-image/graalvm-native-image-quick-start/)

<img alt="native-image-quickstart" src="https://github.com/graalvm/workshops/actions/workflows/github-actions-native-image-quickstart.yml/badge.svg" /></a>

>  Workshop to gently introduce you to working with GraalVM Native Image. In the workshop you will:
>  - Build and run a Java application, using GraalVM
>  - Turn a Java application into a native executable, using GraalVM Native Image
>  - Build a native executable that works with the dynamic features of Java
>  - Use the Maven GraalVM plugin to build a native executable using GraalVM Native Image.

### ![Lab Flask](./images/lab-flask.png) [Multi-Cloud Apps with GraalVM - Up and Running](native-image/spring-boot-webserver/)
<a href="https://github.com/graalvm/workshops/actions/workflows/github-actions-spring-boot-webserver.yml">

> Workshop is for developers looking to understand better how to build **size-optimized** Java applications using [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/). In the workshop you will:
> Compile a Spring Boot web server, hosting GraalVM documentation pages, ahead of time into a native executable and optimize it for file size
> See how to use the [GraalVM Native Image Maven Plugin](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html)
> Create native executables and run them inside different base containers, including Paketo Buildpacks
> Shrink a container image size by taking advantage of different Native Image containerisation and linking options

> Run on an Oracle-owned tenancy (Luna Labs): [https://luna.oracle.com/lab/b644a03a-8238-4293-a586-55e5b0ec6186](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/b644a03a-8238-4293-a586-55e5b0ec6186)

>  - Learn about the _GraalVM Native Image Build Tools for Maven_

### ![Lab Flask](./images/lab-flask.png) [GraalVM Native Image, Spring & Containers](native-image/containerisation/)
<a href="https://github.com/graalvm/workshops/actions/workflows/github-actions-native-image-containerisation.yml">
   <img alt="native-image-quickstart" src="https://github.com/graalvm/workshops/actions/workflows/github-actions-native-image-containerisation.yml/badge.svg" /></a>

>  Workshop introducing using GraalVM Native Image in containers. In this workshop you will:
>  - Add a basic Spring Boot application to a Docker Image and run it
>  - Build a native executable from this application, using GraalVM Native Image
>  - Add the native executable to a Docker Image
>  - Shrink your application docker image size with GraalVM Native Image and Distroless containers
