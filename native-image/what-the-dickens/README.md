What do Micronaut, Spring Native, Quarkus and Helidon have in common? 
They all support [GraalVM Native Image](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/enterprise/latest/docs/reference-manual/native-image/) ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to transform a Java application into a native executable that starts almost instantaneously, provides peak performance with no warmup, and requires less memory and less CPU.

It's perfect for your containerised workloads and microservices where it's critical to minimise your startup time and reduce your resource consumption. 
In this lab we'll provide a practical introduction to GraalVM Native Image AOT covering how it works, what it can do, and when to use it.

### Lab Objectives

By the end of the lab you will have:
* Built, run and converted a basic Spring Boot application into a native executable
* Added the native Spring Boot application to a container image, deployed it and run it
* Shrunk the size of the container image using Distroless containers
* Seen how to use GraalVM Native Build tools as part of your CI/CD pipeline

Estimated lab time: 60 minutes

# Understanding Containerisation and GraalVM Native Image

## Introduction

This lab takes you step by step through the process of how to containerise GraalVM Native Image applications.

GraalVM Native Image technology compiles Java code ahead-of-time into a native executable file. 
Only the code that is required at run time by the application is included in the executable file.

An executable file produced by Native Image has several important advantages, in that it:

- Uses a fraction of the resources required by the JVM, so is cheaper to run
- Starts in milliseconds
- Delivers peak performance immediately, with no warmup
- Can be packaged into a lightweight container image for faster and more efficient deployment
- Presents a reduced attack surface (more on this in future labs)

Many of the leading microservice frameworks support ahead-of-time compilation with GraalVM Native Image, including
Micronaut, Spring, Helidon, and Quarkus.

In addition, there are Maven and Gradle plugins for Native Image so you can easily build,
test, and run Java applications as executable files.

(Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides GraalVM Enterprise at no additional cost.)

# This is where you will need to do something
```

## Lab Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you must have installed:

* [GraalVM Installation 22 or later, JDK17 +](https://github.com/graalvm/get.graalvm.org/) - We recommend the Enterprise Edition 
* The `native-image` tool (see [Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/docs/getting-started/#native-image))
* Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your GraalVM installation
* Maven 3.0 or above
* A Docker-API compatible container runtime such as [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/), [Docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/), or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

## **STEP 1**: Introducing the Sample Java Application

In this lab you are going to build a sample application with a minimal REST-based API. 
You are then going to containerise the application.
First, take a quick look at the sample application.

The source code, resources, and build scripts for the application are in _native-image/what-the-dickens/lab/src_.
The application is built on top of the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.

The application has two classes:

* `com.example.DickensApplication`: The main Spring Boot class
* `com.example.DickensController`: A REST controller class that implements the logic of the application and defines the HTTP endpoints `/whatTheDickens` and `/whatTheDickens/{number}`.

So, what does the application do? If you call the endpoint `/whatTheDickens`, it will return 10 lines of nonsense prose generated
in the style of [Charles Dickens' novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens#Novels).
The application achieves this by using a [Markov Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to produce a statistical model of Dickens' original prose. 
This model is then used to generate new text.

The example application ingests the text of 12 of Dickens' novels (in _main/resources/_), from which it creates a model.
The application then uses the model to generate new text that is similar to the original text. 
The [RiTa](https://rednoise.org/rita/) library does the heavy lifting for you--it provides the functionality to build and use Markov Chains.

Below are two snippets from class `com.example.DickensController`. 

1. The first snippet shows how the model is created and then populated with `sentences` ingested from some of Dickens' novels.
The model is created and populated from the class initializer.

    ```java
    private final static RiMarkov MARKOV_MODEL = new RiMarkov(5);
    ...
    MARKOV_MODEL.addText(sentences);
    ```

2. In the second snippet you can see the method that generates new lines of prose from the model.

    ```java
    public String generate(final int numLines) {
      String[] lines = MARKOV_MODEL.generate(numLines, GEN_MAP);
      StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
      for (String line : lines) {
        sb.append("<p>");
        sb.append(line);
        sb.append("</p>");
      }
      return sb.toString();
    }
    ```

Take a little while to view the code and acquaint yourself with it.

Build your application: from the root directory of the project, run the following commands in your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
cd native-image/what-the-dickens/lab
./mvnw clean package
```

This will generate an "executable" JAR file, one that contains all the application's dependencies as well as a correctly configured _MANIFEST_
file. You can run this JAR file as follows:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
# Run the application in the background
java -jar ./target/What_the_Dickens-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
```

When the application starts, you should see something similar to the following:

```
Started DickensApplication in 50.537 seconds (process running for 52.359)
```

Use the `curl` command to call the application's endpoints to see what the application returns.

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
# Call the endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/whatTheDickens
curl http://localhost:8080/whatTheDickens/30
```

Did you get the some nonsense sentences returned from the application? 

## **STEP 2**: Building a Native Executable

Now you can create a native executable from your Java application using GraalVM Native Image. The native executable
is going to exhibit two interesting characteristics, namely:

1. It is going to start really fast
2. It will use fewer resources than its corresponding Java application

You can use the Native Image tooling installed with GraalVM to build a native executable of a Java
application from the command line, but as you are using Maven already, you are going to use the 
[GraalVM Native Image Build Tools for Maven](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html) which will
conveniently allow you to carry on using Maven.

One way of building a native executable is to use a Maven [profile](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html), 
which will allow you to decide whether you want to build the JAR file or the native executable. 

The Maven _pom.xml_ file contains a profile that builds a native executable. 
(For more details see [Registering the plugin](https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/maven-plugin.html#configuration-registering-plugin).)
Take a closer look:

The profile is declared and given a name.

```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>native</id>
        <!-- Rest of profile hidden, to highlight relevant parts -->
    </profile>
</profiles>
```

Next, within the profile, the GraalVM Native Image Build Tools plugin is included and attached to the `package` phase in Maven.
This means it will run as a part of the `package` phase. 

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
      <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>build-native</id>
          <phase>package</phase>
          <goals>
              <goal>compile-no-fork</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

The Native Image tool relies on the static analysis of an applicationâ€™s reachable code at runtime. 
However, the analysis cannot always completely predict all usages of the Java Native Interface (JNI), Java Reflection, Dynamic Proxy objects, or class path resources. 
Undetected usages of these dynamic features must be provided to Native Image in the form of metadata (precomputed in code or as JSON configuration files).
GraalVM provides a [Tracing Agent](https://docs.oracle.com/graalvm/enterprise/22/docs/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/) to easily gather metadata and create configuration files.
The agent tracks all usages of dynamic features during application execution on a regular Java VM.
Spring should generate most of this configuration automatically, but the tracing agent can be used to quickly identify missing entries.

Use the command below to launch the Spring application with the Native Image tracing agent attached. 
(For more information, see [Using the Tracing Agent](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.0.5/reference/htmlsingle/#native-image.advanced.using-the-tracing-agent).)

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
java -Dpring.aot.enabled=true \
-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/ \ 
-jar target/What_the_Dickens-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Stop the application with Ctrl-C.
On application shutdown the tracing agent writes the configuration files to the specified output directory. 
In this case, it's the directory that Native Image reads when it runs.

Now run the Maven build using the profile, as below (note that the profile name is specified with the `-P` option, and you can skip the tests this time):

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
./mvnw -Pnative -DskipTests=true package 
```

This will generate a native executable in the _target_ directory, named _What\_the\_Dickens_. Take a 
look at the size of the file:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
ls -lh ./target/What_the_Dickens
```

 ls -lh target/What_the_Dickens                             -rwxr-xr-x  1 bhoran  staff    70M Apr 12 12:57 target/What_the_Dickens*


Run this native executable from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
./target/What_the_Dickens &
```

When the application starts, you should see something similar to the following:

```
Started DickensApplication in 65.727 seconds (process running for 66.15)
```

Test it, using the following commands from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/What_the_Dickens
curl http://localhost:8080/What_the_Dickens/30
```

Now you have a native executable of your application--however, it starts no faster than the original Java version.
This is mainly because the performance is constrained by the amount of time the application takes to ingest the Dickens' novels. 

Stop the application before you move on, using Ctrl-C.

OK TO HERE

## **STEP 3**: Reducing the Startup Time of Your Native Executable

Notice that you can pass configuration options and parameters to the underlying Native Image
build tool using the `buildArgs` element of the _pom.xml_ file. 
In individual `buildArg` elements you can pass in options in exactly the same way
as you do to Native Image, so you can use all of the options that Native Image accepts. 
One of those is the option to [Specify Class Initialization Explicitly](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/enterprise/22/docs/reference-manual/native-image/guides/specify-class-initialization/) using the `initialize-at-build-time` option.

The Maven _pom.xml_ file contains a profile named `native-static` that passes in the `initialize-at-build-time` argument as shown below:

```xml
<configuration>
    <buildArgs>
        <buildArg>--initialize-at-build-time=rita.RiMarkov,com.example.DickensController</buildArg>
    </buildArgs>
</configuration>
```

This causes the static initializer of classes `rita.RiMarkov` and `com.example.DickensController` to be run when Native Image builds the native executable.

Now run the Maven build using the profile, as below:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
./mvnw -Pnative-static -DskipTests=true package 
```
<!-- Should we tell the user to ignore the warnings here ^^? -->

This will generate a native executable in the _target_ directory, named _What\_the\_Dickens_. The build output should contain something similar to :

```
Apr 12, 2023 4:23:17 PM com.example.DickensController <clinit>
INFO: Time taken to ingest books: 23,380ms
```

Take a look at the size of the file:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
ls -lh ./target/What_the_Dickens
```

Run this native executable from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
./target/What_the_Dickens &
```

When the application starts, you should see something similar to the following:

```
Started DickensApplication in 65.727 seconds (process running for 66.15)
```

Test it, using the following commands from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/What_the_Dickens
curl http://localhost:8080/What_the_Dickens/30
```

Now you have a native executable of your application--however, it starts no faster than the original Java version.
This is mainly because the performance is constrained by the amount of time the application takes to ingest the Dickens' novels. 

Stop the application before you move on, using Ctrl-C.

## **STEP 4**: Containerising your Native Executable

So you have a native executable version of your application, and you have seen it working. Now to containerise it.

A simple Dockerfile for packaging this native executable is in the directory
_native-image/what-the-dickens/lab/01-native-image/Dockerfile_.
The contents are shown below, along with explanatory comments.
This is a two-step build: the first part builds the native executable, using GraalVM Native Image; the 
second step copies the native executable into a smaller container for use.

>    ### Note: Why Are We Using a Two-Step Build?
>
>    The native executable produced GraalVM Native Image is for the platform that on which you run Native Image.
>    
>    So, if you are running on macOS, it will generate a mach64 executable. 
>    If you are running on Linux, it will generate an ELF Linux executable (for the architecture of the chip you are running on). 
>    If you want to containerise your application in a container image and you are running on macOS, 
>    then you can't simply build the executable locally (as that will be a macOS-compatible executable) and package it 
>    within your container image which expects the executable to be a Linux-compatible executable. 
> 
>    Therefore, if you are developing on an OS other than Linux, you need to first build within a container with a 
>    Linux version of GraalVM to create an executable that can then be packaged into another container.
>    That is what the multi-stage build here achieves. The first step in the process builds a Linux
>    compatible executable and the second step packages that into a container image for deployment.


```dockerfile
# Base Container Image
FROM ghcr.io/graalvm/graalvm-ce:ol8-java17-22 AS builder

# Install tar and gzip to extract the Maven binaries
RUN microdnf update \
 && microdnf install --nodocs \
    tar \
    gzip \
 && microdnf clean all \
 && rm -rf /var/cache/yum

# Set the working directory to /build
WORKDIR /build

# Copy the source code into the container for building
COPY . /build

# Build
RUN ./mvnw --no-transfer-progress clean package -Pnative -DskipTests=true

# The deployment container image
FROM docker.io/oraclelinux:8-slim

EXPOSE 8080

# Copy the native executable into the container
COPY --from=builder /build/target/What_the_Dickens .
ENTRYPOINT ["/What_the_Dickens"]
```

> ### Note: Building on Linux
> If you are using Linux you don't need to use a multi-stage build and your build times will be faster.
> You can just build the native executable locally and package it in the deployment container _01-native-image/Dockerfile.linux_
> as follows:
> ```bash
> ./mvnw clean package -Pnative
> docker build -f ./01-native-image/Dockerfile.linux --build-arg APP_FILE=target/What_the_Dickens -t What_the_Dickens:native.01 .
> ```

To build, run the following from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
# Build a Container Image
docker build -f ./01-native-image/Dockerfile \
             -t what_the_dickens:native.01 .
# List the newly built container image
docker images | head -n2
```

And that is it. You can run this from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
docker run --rm --name "what_the_dickens-native" -p 8080:8080 what_the_dickens:native.01
```

When the Spring application has started, test it as before:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/whatTheDickens
curl http://localhost:8080/whatTheDickens/30
```

Again, you should see more nonsense prose in the style of the Dickens' novels. 

You can see how long the application took to startup by inspecting the output from the container.
In our experiments, the native executable started up in 122.215s (compared to 3.896s for the Java application). A big improvement!

```
2023-04-13T12:28:12.386Z  INFO 1 --- [           main] com.example.DickensApplication           : Started DickensApplication in 122.215 seconds (process running for 122.276)
```

Stop your container (using Ctrl-C) before moving onto the next step.


But before you go to the next step, take a look at the size of the container produced:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
size_in_bytes=`docker inspect -f "{{ .Size }}" what_the_dickens:native.01`
echo $((size_in_bytes/1024/1024))
```

The container image size we saw in our experiments was 188MB. 

## **STEP 5**: Building a Mostly Static Executable and Packaging it in a Distroless Image

Let's recap, again, what you have done:

1. You have built a Spring Boot application with a HTTP endpoint, `/whatTheDickens`
2. You have built a native executable of your application using the Native Image build Tools for Maven
3. You have containerised your native executable

In this step, you will shrink your container size even further--smaller containers are quicker to download and start.
With GraalVM Native Image you have the ability to statically link system libraries into the native executable.
If you build a statically linked native executable, you can package the native executable directly into an empty 
container image, also known as a "scratch" container.

Another option is to produce what is known as a mostly-statically linked native executable. With this, you statically link
in all system libraries except for the standard C library, `glibc`. With such a native executable you can use a small container,
such as Google's Distroless which contains the `glibc` library, some standard files, and SSL security certificates. The
standard Distroless container is around 20MB in size.

You will build a mostly-statically linked executable and then package it into a Distroless container.

The _pom.xml_ tile contains a Maven profile (named `distroless`) to build this mostly-statically linked native executable.
The only difference between this profile and the one you used before, `native`, is that it includes the option `-H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC`.
This instructs Native Image to build a mostly-statically linked native executable. The following is
a snippet from the `distroless` profile in the _pom.xml_ file that includes this option:

```xml
<buildArgs>
  ...
  <!-- Mostly static -->
  <buildArg>-H:+StaticExecutableWithDynamicLibC</buildArg>
</buildArgs>
```

You can build your mostly-statically linked native executable as follows--be aware this will only work on Linux. We will
build our native executable in a container in the next step, so if you are using macOS, don't worry.

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
./mvnw package -Pdistroless -DskipTests=true
```

The generated native executable is in the _target_ directory, named __What\_the\_Dickens-distroless_.

Now to package it into a Distroless container. The Dockerfile to do this can be found in the directory 
_native-image/what-the-dickens/lab/02-smaller-containers/Dockerfile_. Again you are going to use a multi-stage build
in order to build a Linux executable on all OSes. Take a look at the contents of the Dockerfile, 
which has explanatory comments:

```dockerfile
# Base Container Image
FROM ghcr.io/graalvm/graalvm-ce:ol8-java17-22 AS builder

# Install tar and gzip to extract the Maven binaries
RUN microdnf update \
 && microdnf install --nodocs \
    tar \
    gzip \
 && microdnf clean all \
 && rm -rf /var/cache/yum

# Set the working directory to /build
WORKDIR /build

# Copy the source code into the image for building
COPY . /build

# Build
RUN ./mvnw --no-transfer-progress clean package -Pdistroless -DskipTests=true

# Deployment Container
# This time we use the distroless image - which is around 20 MB in size. Even smaller versions are available.
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base

# This container will expose TCP port 8080, as this is the port on which your app will listen
EXPOSE 8080

# Copy the native executable into the container
COPY --from=builder /build/target/What_the_Dickens-distroless .

# Run What_the_Dickens-distroless when starting the container
ENTRYPOINT ["/What_the_Dickens-distroless"]
```

> ### Note: Building on Linux
> If you are using Linux you don't need to use a multi-stage build and your build times will be faster.
> You can just build the native executable locally and package it in our deployment container _02-smaller-containers/Dockerfile.linux_
> as follows:
> ```bash
> ./mvnw clean package -Pdistroless
> docker build -f ./02-smaller-containers/Dockerfile.linux --build-arg APP_FILE=target/What_the_Dickens -t What_the_Dickens:distroless.01 .
> ```

To build, run the following command from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
# Build a Container Image
docker build -f ./02-smaller-containers/Dockerfile \
             -t what_the_dickens:distroless.01 .
# List the newly built image
docker images | head -n2
```
You can run this from your terminal:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```shell
docker run --rm --name "what_the_dickens-distroless" -p 8080:8080 what_the_dickens:distroless.01
```

When the Spring application has started, test it as before:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/whatTheDickens
curl http://localhost:8080/whatTheDickens/30
```

You can see how long the application took to startup by inspecting the output from the container.
In our experiments, the native executable started up in 0.074s (compared to 3.896s for the Java application). A big improvement!

```
2022-03-09 19:44:12.642  INFO 1 --- [           main] com.example.demo.DemoApplication         : Started DemoApplication in 0.667 seconds (JVM running for 0.779)
```

Stop your container (using Ctrl-C) before moving onto the next step.


Great! It worked. But how small, or large, is your container? Use the following commands to check the image size:

![](images/RMIL_Technology_Laptop_Bark_RGB_50.png#input)
```shell
size_in_bytes=`docker inspect -f "{{ .Size }}" jibber:distroless.01`
echo $((size_in_bytes/1024/1024))
```

In our experiments, we saw a size of around 82MB, compared to 171MB for an Oracle Linux 8 
image. So we have shrunk the container by a lot. A long way down from our starting size, for 
the original container, of almost 600MB.

## Summary

We hope you have enjoyed this lab and learnt a few things along the way. We've looked at how you can containerise
a Java application. Then we've seen how to convert that Java application into a native executable, which starts significantly 
faster than the Java application. You then containerised the native executable and have seen how the size of the 
container image, with your native executable in it, is much smaller than the Java container Image.

Finally, we looked at how we can build a mostly-statically linked native executable with Native Image. These can be
packaged in smaller containers, such as Distroless and these let us shrink the size of the container Image even further.
