# ![Lab Flask](../images/lab-flask.png) VS Code Tools for Micronaut

In this lab we will introduce you to the Micronaut&reg; tooling available within VS Code. This tooling is very feature rich and makes building and working with Micronaut applciations easy. Let's get started.


**Estimated lab time: 90 minutes**

## Lab Objectives

During this lab, we will introduce you to the Tools for Micronaut extension for VS Code. This extension supports working and building Micronaut applications. You will:

- Install VS Code and the Tools for Micronaut extension.
- Create a Micronaut application within VS Code.
- Navigate around your application.
- Use the code creation automation:
  - Create a REST controller.
  - Use autocomplete within properties files.
- Discover what the Micronaut Activity view can do:
  - Use the Micronaut Activity View to run the application.
  - Navigate around the application's endpoints and beans.
  - Make a REST call.
  - Add the Micronaut Control Panel to your application.
  - Monitor & manage your application in real-time.
- Use the Micronaut Expression Language.
- Work with an Oracle Database:
  - Connect to a database.
  - Create Micronaut Data entities, repositories from an existing database schema, and then REST controllers using the tooling.
  - Run your application using the attached database.
  - Generate tests for your controllers.
- Use Visual VM from within VS Code:
  - Install Visual VM from within VS Code.
  - Use the integrated Visual VM support to solve performance issues in your application.
- Work with cloud resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):
  - Learn how to work with Oracle Cloud (OCI) resources within your application.
  - Add an Object Storage bucket to your application.
  - Run the application using the attached Object Storage Bucket.

>Note: If you see the laptop icon in the lab, this means you need to do something, such as enter a command. Keep an eye out for it.

## Lab Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you must have:

* A recent install of VS Code. If you don't have it, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* An install of the most recent version of Oracle GraalVM. Please read the GraalVM documentation for more details: [Download Oracle GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).
* An Oracle ATP instance with the HR schema installed. If you can not create an ATP instance and install the schema then we can provide you with a pre-configured instance.

## Install the Tools for Micronaut Extension

For this lab you will need to install the following two extensions into VS Code:

* [MS Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).
* [tools for Micronaut® Framework](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oracle-labs-graalvm.micronaut-tools).

You can either install directly from within the VS Code marketplace, links above, or through the extensions activity view within VS Code.

## Create a Micronaut Application

We start this lab by creating a simple Micronaut application and seeing how our tooling can progressively support us in adding features to it. We will also see how easy it is to run and interact with our application using our tools, but the first step is to create an application. Let's do that now.

An application can be created using the 

## Navigate Around your Application

## Code Creation Automation

### Create a REST controller

### Autocomplete within properties files

## Discover what the Micronaut Activity View Can Do

### Use the Micronaut Activity View to run the application 
### Naviagte around the end points and beans
### Make a REST call
### Add the Micronaut Control Panel to your application
### Monitor & manage your application in realtime

## Use the Micronaut Expression Language

## Work with an Oracle Database

### Connect to a database
### Create Micronaut Data entities, repositories from and REST controllers to expose an existing database schema
### Run youe application using the attached database
### Generate tests for your controllers

## Use Visual VM from within VS Code

### Install Visual VM from within VS Code
### Use the integrated Visual VM support to solve performance issues in your application

## Work with Cloud Resources in OCI

### Learn how to work with Oracle Cloud (OCI) resources within your application
### Add an Object Storage bucket to your application
### Run the application using the attached Object Storage Bucket

## Summary

We hope you have enjoyed this lab and learnt a few things along the way. You have seen the variety of benefits offered by the Tools for Micronaut extension. These include:

* The ability to monitor and manage you rapplication from within VS Code.
* Easy code creation for a host of mundane tasks.
* Easily connecting to and working with databases.
* Creating complete REST APIs from existing database schemas with
