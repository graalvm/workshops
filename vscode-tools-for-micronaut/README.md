# VS Code Tools for Micronaut

In this lab we will introduce you to the Micronaut tooling available within VS Code. This tooling is very feature rich and makes building and working with Micronaut applciations easy.


### blab intro


Estimated lab time: 60 minutes

## Lab Objectives

In this lab you we will introduce you to the Tools for Micronaut extension for VS Code. This extension supports working and building Micronaut application. You will:

- Install VS Code and the Tools for Micronaut extension
- Create a Micronaut application within VS Code

- Naviagte around your application

- Code creation Automation
  - Create a REST controller
  - Autocomplete within properties files

- Discover what the Micronaut Activity view can do
  - Use the Micronaut Activity View to run the application 
  - Naviagte around the end points and beans
  - Make a REST call
  - Add the Micronaut Control Panel to your application
  - Monitor & manage your application in realtime

- Use the Micronaut Expression Language

- Work with an Oracle Database
  - Connect to a database
  - Create Micronaut Data entities, repositories from and REST controllers to expose an existing database schema
  - Run youe application using the attached database
  - Generate tests for your controllers

- Use Visual VM from within VS Code
  - Install Visual VM from within VS Code
  - Use the integrated Visual VM support to solve performance issues in your application

- Work with cloud resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
  - Learn how to work with Oracle Cloud (OCI) resources within your application
  - Add an Object Storage bucket to your application
  - Run the application using the attached Object Storage Bucket

>Note: If you see the laptop icon in the lab, this means you need to do something such as enter a command. Keep an eye out for it.

## Lab Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you must have:

* A recent install of VS Code, if you don't you can [download if here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* Install of most recent version of Oracle GraalVM. This can be done using the command line tool, `sdkman`. Please ateka  look at thsi for more details: [Download Oracle GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).
* An Oracle ATP instance with the HR schema installed. for this labe we will provide you with a pre-configured instance that you can use. We will supply the details later on in the lab.

### Installing Oracle GraalVM

1. Install sdkman.
2. install graalvm and make it the default.

## Install the Tools for Micronaut Extension

In order to get all of the Micronaut features within VS Code, that we will look at in th is lab, you first need to install the extension. 

TODO: Install MS Java Extension Pack
TODO: Copy from the GDK install page - actual install is different, but 

Discuss that it can be installed directly from within the MS Java extension New Project Wizard.

## Create a Micronaut Application

In this lab we will start out with a simple Micronaut application and see how our tooling can progressively support us in adding features to this. We will see how easy it is to run and interact with our application using our tool, but the first step is top  create an application. Let's do that now.

## Navigate Around your Application

## Code Creation Automation

### Create a REST controller

### Autocomplete within properties files

## Discover what the Micronaut Activity View Can Do

### Use the Micronaut Activity View to run the application 
### Naviagte around the end points and beans
### Make a REST call
### Add the Micronaut Control Panel to your application
### Monitor & manage your application in realtime

## Use the Micronaut Expression Language

## Work with an Oracle Database

### Connect to a database
### Create Micronaut Data entities, repositories from and REST controllers to expose an existing database schema
### Run youe application using the attached database
### Generate tests for your controllers

## Use Visual VM from within VS Code

### Install Visual VM from within VS Code
### Use the integrated Visual VM support to solve performance issues in your application

## Work with Cloud Resources in OCI

### Learn how to work with Oracle Cloud (OCI) resources within your application
### Add an Object Storage bucket to your application
### Run the application using the attached Object Storage Bucket

## Summary

We hope you have enjoyed this lab and learnt a few things along the way. You have seen the variety of benefits offered by the Tools for Micronaut extension. These include:

* The ability to monitor and manage you rapplication from within VS Code.
* Easy code creation for a host of mundane tasks.
* Easily connecting to and working with databases.
* Creating complete REST APIs from existing database schemas with
